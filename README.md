Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective:
      The objective of this task is to capture live network traffic using Wireshark and analyze different network protocols to understand packet-level communication.

Tool Used:
      Wireshark (Free Network Protocol Analyzer)

Steps Performed:
      1. Installed Wireshark successfully.
      2. Started live packet capture on the active network interface.
      3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging google.com.
      4. Stopped the capture after one minute.
      5. Applied protocol filters to analyze traffic.
      6. Identified multiple protocols.
      7. Saved the capture file in .pcap format.

Protocols Identified:
      TCP – Used for reliable data transmission.
      DNS – Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
      TLS (HTTPS) – Encrypted web communication.


Packet Analysis Summary
      The capture shows DNS query packets when accessing websites, TCP packets for connection establishment, and TLS packets indicating encrypted HTTPS traffic.

Files Included:
    `task5_network_capture.pcap` – Network traffic capture file
    `screenshots/` – Evidence of capture and analysis
